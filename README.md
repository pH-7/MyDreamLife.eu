# MyDreamLife

MyDreamLife is a side-project I created to give a TODO-list, and Itinerary for a new (exciting) life. It is designed for European people from 18 to 30 (mainly from Spain, France, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and Italy) who want to move and try a new life abroad but don't know the process to do it.

The artificial intelligence of the app will give them, ste-by-step, the whole map for starting their dream life & doing it!


## It's not MyDreamLife.eu, but MyNewDream.eu

Although both domain names were available, I distractedly typed a different name (maybe because I was speaking to people and drinking in the same time ...).
After the payment made, I sadly noticed my mistake but it was already too late.. Anyway, "MyDreamLife.eu" is actually "MyNewDream.eu"! There is worse in life!
